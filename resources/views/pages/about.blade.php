        	I am a freelance coder. I work for different companies, individuals, do partial or a whole project depending on the size and technology used in it. Being a programmer I code in almost all the popular/semi-popular or new/old languages, that is something I do on the basis of the requirement of the clients.
        <br><br>
        As technology is changing/breaking records everyday, I love to stay updated and touch all the possible points of new techniques/platforms/framworks/patterns. Web designing these days is crucial and it is very chalenging to keep all the parcials to work as a whole, that is because you use multiple different dependancies and you never know when anyone or two of them going to go out of the market <br>OR<br> keep them selves recreating sometimes re-imagining everything from scratch.

        <br><br>
        I belive in being expert, being familier with all the aspects of the technology people use around us and want to use.
